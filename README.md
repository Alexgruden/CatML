# Assignment 8, CS3250

TODO: Update this README and fill out the reflection questions.

This repository contains a (template) implementation of CatML, an ML variant used at UVM for CS3250.

## Building this repository with `dune`

This repository can be built with [`dune`](https://github.com/ocaml/dune), a build system for OCaml projects. It helps manage linking when your project is made up of multiple `.ml` files.

### Install `dune`

Check if dune is already installed via the following terminal command:

```
$ dune --version
```

If the command is not found, you can install it via `opam` [(detailed instructions)](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/install-dune.html).

```
$ opam install dune
$ eval $(opam config env)
$ dune --version
```

### Build the project

With `dune` installed, you can build the project by running `dune build` from the command line.

```
$ dune build
```

You can also access the project modules by running `dune utop`, which will build the project and then open the `utop` toplevel. Different files (such as `src/lang.ml`) correspond to OCaml modules, and data structures (such as the `Var` constructor in the CatML AST) can be accessed via `CatML.Lang.Bool`, where `CatML` is the overall name of the project.

### Structure of the repository

```
- <root>
  - dune-project
  - src
    - dune
    - lang.ml
    - lexer.mll
    - parser.mly
    - main.ml
  - examples
    - example.catml
    - factorial.catml
```

The `dune-project` plaintext file at the top level tells dune how to build your project. The file `src/dune` tells dune the name of the library (`CatML`) and the fact that we have a ocamllex file `lexer.mll` and a menhir parser specification file `parser.mly` in the `src` subdirectory.

```
(library (name CatML))
(menhir (modules parser))
(ocamllex lexer)
```

The files in the `src` directory include:

- `lang.ml`: The main definition of the CatML language, including syntax, evaluation, and type checking
- `lexer.mll`: The specification of the lexer used by ocamllex
- `parser.mly`: The specification of the parser used by menhir
- `main.ml`: Demonstration of how to access the lexer and parser generated from the above files

In the `examples` directory I have included two sample CatML programs. You should write your own additional CatML programs to test your work.
